Dissipative particle dynamics refers to a particlebased numerical method 
in which  the  dynamicsof  particles  that interact through conservative, 
dissipative, and random forces are computed. The method is coarse-grained 
molecular dynamicsand has the ability to capture flow at mesoscopic scales,
i.e., those scales that lie between microscopic and macroscopic ones. 

The barostat is a tool to control the pressure in molecular dynamics method. 
The Berendsen barostat proposes an external bath so that the global pressure
is weakly coupled to this pressure bath and the volume periodically rescaled,
using the principle of the least local perturbation consistent withthe 
required global coupling.
